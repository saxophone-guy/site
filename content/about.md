### Who am I?

Hey! I'm Archit, also known as `saxophone` on the internet. I'm a developer who codes for fun and digs deep into computers. Most of my time is spent working with C and C++, although sometimes I use assembly (both x86 and ARM)

### What I do

I enjoy optimizing code and making it memory-safe, although I do tinker with a bit of everything. My projects revolve around low-level programming, where I focus on squeezing out performance while keeping things stable and secure. I'm fascinated by the internals of operating systems, networking, and compilers, which is why you'll often find me experimenting with assembly and system-level code. Also, I love math.

### Interests

When I'm not coding, I dive into other aspects of the sciences, from setting up goofy hardware configurations to dangerous, explosive, chemistry (I made a gun that uses plastic toys as gunpowder once).

I also love:
- Frontend stuff: I dabble in most JS frameworks
- Backend stuff: I can make a fullstack site in a week or so.

### Contact me

Feel free to reach out! Whether it's to discuss tech, collaborate, or just chat, I'm always up for connecting with people.
